 I just woke up from a dream, but you and I had to say goodbye. And I don't know what it all means. But since I survived, I realized, wherever you go, that's where I'll follow. Nobody's promised tomorrow. So I would love you every night, like it's the last night. Like it's the last night, if the world was ending, I'd want to be next to you. And if the party was over, and I'd tell my mom, I was through. I'd want to hold with you just for a while, and tell me this far, if the world was ending, I'd want to be next to you. Oh, lost, lost in the worth that we skate. I don't even want to do this anymore, because you already know what you mean to me. And I love the only one who I'm fighting for. Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow. Nobody's promised tomorrow. So I would love you every night, like it's the last night. Like it's the last night, if the world was ending, I'd want to be next to you. If the party was over, and I'd tell my mom, I was through. I'd want to hold with you just for a while, and tell me this far, if the world was ending, I'd want to be next to you. Right next to you. Right next to you. Right next to you. Oh-oh... If the world was sending, I'd wanna be next to you If the party was so warm, and don't turn them on, it was true I'd wanna hold you just for a while And don't wait for the smile If the world was sending, I'd wanna be next to you If the world was sending, I'd wanna be next to you I'd wanna be next to you
